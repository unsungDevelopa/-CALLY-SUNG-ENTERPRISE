# CALLY & SUNG ENTERPRISE WEBSITE

"Time, not money, is our most valuable asset. It has been three years since I started my journey in web development and graphic design, although the last two have been actively leaning towards the former. Both are transforming me, if not yet transformed, to be better at versioning everything I do. Recently, I started writing lines of code again and began with a dummy project—an e-commerce website for my brand—to refresh my mind about CSS styling."S
